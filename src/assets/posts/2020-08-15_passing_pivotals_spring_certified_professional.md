# Passing Pivotal's "Spring Certified  Professional"

---

without the expensive training :)

[Spring Certified Professional](https://tanzu.vmware.com/training/certification/spring-professional-certification) is testing your 
knowledge of Spring Core. These are the exam topics (50 questions in total) and your job to score 76% or higher. Questions will
appear in following proportions:

- Container (20%)
- AOP (8%)
- JDBC (4%)
- Transactions (8%)
- MVC (8%)
- Security (6%)
- REST (6%)
- JPA Spring Data (4%)
- Testing (4%)
- Boot Into (8%)
- Boot Autoconfig (8%)
- Boot Actuator (8%)
- Boot Testing (8%)

I scored 80%, and here is my experience:

Spring has a bit of a different approach to examination. They set the bar higher 
(in Oracle Java Certifications the passing grade is somewhere around 60%) but there are no trick questions. Everything is 
straightforward, and you either know it or you don't.

In general, you definitely want to keep addressing the questions that are provided in the study guide. But reading about them as 
a theory is so NOT enough. I did that many times over, and it just flies right out of your head unless you have incorporated 
them into code at least in a pet project. Therefore, I am a huge proponent of practice.

### Things that helped:
#### Books

Any book you read on Spring is a good idea, however things get outdated quickly, and programming has moved into declarative 
programming style (programming with annotations) and latest Spring exam (Spring 5) doesn't include XML configuration, 
so I would advise you to focus on books written in 2018 and later:

 - Spring in Action 5 (or 6 - it is coming out soon)
 - Spring Security in Action

#### Udemy

Dominik Cebula created [a bunch of udemy courses](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?q=Dominik+cebula) addressing different 
modules and providing answers to questions. Honestly, lack of emotion in his voice might put you to sleep but if you are like me, 
and feel a bit lazy looking all over documentation to find the answer to a specific question (which is not always easy to find) 
his answers are all there, structured and on point - so worth checking out.

#### Projects

This should be the biggest point - any concept you incorporate into your own project gives +100 to understanding and retention :)
So always be programming, and incorporate new concepts (AOP, Security, etc) one by one. That will make prepare you on those 
concepts like nothing else.

The benchmark is:
 - Written 1 Spring Project: Looking at 50% Score
 - 2nd Spring Project: 65%+
 - 3rd Spring Project: You should be able to pass

#### Answering questions on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

Anything you do that helps other people is worth doing. In this case it helps you as well. Giving answers requires you to 
formulate your thoughts in a structured and concise way, which facilitates your own understanding. Often you will have to quickly 
look up something you have recently read to give a better answer or to provide a link and that will increase material retention 
and not least of the benefits is the confidence boost in your own knowledge that you get.

Mock questions:

This is a pain. There are no good options and the only 2 options are:

 - [itestjava.com](itestjava.com), it is far from perfect, has outdated questions but unfortunately 
I haven’t found anything better for Spring 5 Exam.
 - Free app (only on Google Store - I am guessing because Android apps can be written in Java) with Spring 5 Practice Tests – 
 - worth checking it out but also outdated xml configuration questions. Also, questions are almost identical to itestjava.com.

That was it - I wish you good luck with your exam. If you have some questions you are welcome to contact me, 
will be glad to help and/or post a blog post explaining it :)
