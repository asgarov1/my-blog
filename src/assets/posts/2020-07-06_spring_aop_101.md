# Spring Aop 101

---

Aspect Oriented Programming is best suited to address crosscutting concerns - 
crosscutting concern is anything that can be decomposed from the rest of application and often results in 
code duplication such as logging or security. You can imagine how much more practical is it to define all the 
logging in one class/package instead having it in between lines of code ALL OVER the application. AOP increases 
code readability and maintainability by keeping things clean and neat.

**Terminology** - no need to learn this by heart right now, just keep referring to this during reading

- Joinpoint - is a well-defined point during the execution of your application, for example a method call. 
Basically it is a point in your code where you insert additional logic via AOP.
- Advice - actual code being inserted into the joinpoint.
- Pointcut - a predicate defining joinpoint(s) to define where exactly to execute the advice. Some advices 
should only be executed if certain combination of joinpoints match the criteria - hence the pointcut.
- Aspect - class that encapsulates advice and pointcut definitions.
- Weaving - process of inserting aspects into the application code at appropriate point (at build time or 
dynamically at run time).
- Target - target of the advice, also referred to as advised object.

Beauty of AOP is that you can advise any method/class without them knowing about it - no changes have to be 
implemented in them! Only restriction final classes/methods can't be advised as they can't be overridden in 
Spring AOP.

## So how does Spring AOP work?
Spring creates a Proxy (a wrapping class) for every Target class that you want to use AOP on. Then, when the 
target class/bean need to be injected, proxy class is injected instead. Now when the methods are called they 
are called on the proxy class which executes specified code before/after the called method as it was advised.

### Spring AOP: 5 Types of advice:

- **@Before**: executes before the target method, in case of exception target method won't be executed. 
Example: security - if user isn't logged in, throw an exception and direct him to log in, thus preventing 
him from accessing protected method.
- **@AfterReturning**: only executes upon successful (exceptionless) return of the target method. You can't 
change the returned value, but you can throw an exception to prevent it from being returned.
- **@After**: also known as After finally will execute independent of exceptions taking place or not.
- **@Around**: also known as the most powerful advice, allows to take full control over target method. You can 
define what happens both before and after the target method, and even if target method should at all be executed.
- **@AfterThrowing**: only executes after an exception was thrown from target method. Helpful to reclassify the 
exception or maybe create a central error logging logic

Example - we define a simple class Calculator:

```
@Component
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

Now we define our aspect class:
```
@Aspect
@Component
public class AspectClass {
    @Pointcut("execution(* com.asgarov.quizme.aop.Calculator.add(..))")
    private void addingMethod() {
    }

    @Before("addingMethod()")
    public void beforeAdvice() {
        System.out.println("@Before: Adding method is about to be executed");
    }

    @AfterReturning(value = "addingMethod()", returning = "returnValue")
    public void afterReturningAdvice(int returnValue) {
        System.out.println("@AfterReturning: Adding method has returned " + returnValue);
    }

    @After("addingMethod()")
    public void afterAdvice() {
        System.out.println("@After: Adding method has finished");
    }

    @Around("addingMethod()")
    public int aroundAdvice(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("@Around: BEFORE the adding method");
        int value = (Integer) joinPoint.proceed();
        System.out.println("@Around: AFTER the adding method");
        return value;
    }

    @AfterThrowing("addingMethod()")
    public void throwsAdvice() {
        //since no exception - won't execute
        System.out.println("@AfterThrowing: Adding method throwed an exception");
    }
}
```

Now all is left is to run it and voil√†:

```
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConfigurableApplicationContext ctx = SpringApplication.run(Application.class);
        Calculator calculator = ctx.getBean(Calculator.class);
        System.out.println("2 + 4 = " + calculator.add(2, 4));
    }
}
```

Console output:

```
@Around: BEFORE the adding method
@Before: Adding method is about to be executed
@AfterReturning: Adding method has returned 6
@After: Adding method has finished
@Around: AFTER the adding method
2 + 4 = 6
```

As you can see @Around can change the value being returned. For example:

```
@Around("addingMethod()")
public int aroundAdvice(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
    System.out.println("@Around: BEFORE the adding method");
    int value = (Integer) joinPoint.proceed();
    System.out.println("@Around: AFTER the adding method");
    return value+1;
}
```

This would have produced:

```
...
2 + 4 = 7
```

Which is why @Around is considered most powerful of all advices. That and also because you could even prevent 
method form being executed, or replace the implementation, or pretty much anything you want to do. 
However, like my favorite [book](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1484228073/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=1484228073&linkCode=as2&tag=asgarov1-21&linkId=176e2e347606fc3def94bf5d70fa848a) 
on Spring mentions, don't start using `@Around` all over the place if 
a more specific Advice like `@Before` or `@After` can do the work. Using more specific advices 
communicates intention better and reduces bugs.

I also want to clarify that by default Spring framework uses Interface based proxies and if your advised 
beans don't implement interfaces you need to use CGLIB for subclassing proxies. This is done via 
`@EnableAspectJAutoProxy(proxyTargetClass = true)` annotation.

```
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy(proxyTargetClass = true)
@Configuration
public class Config {
    ...
} 
```

But you don't need to worry about it like in our example if you are using Spring Boot, since Spring Boot 
automatically figures out the types of proxies needed.

## Pointcut Signature
`@Pointcut("execution(public String com.example.pointcutadvice.dao.FooDao.findById(Long))")`

In this example execution is what is known as pointcut designator (PCD).

If you don't want to specify the method (in this case: findById()) you could rewrite the pointcut like so:

`@Pointcut("execution(public * com.example.pointcutadvice.dao.FooDao.*(..))")`

First * allows for any return type. Second * will match any method inside FooDao class with any number/type 
of parameters (..). You can achieve the same result with within PCD:

`@Pointcut("within(com.example.pointcutadvice.dao.FooDao)")`
Here you don't need to specify any methods, parameters or return types since within targets all methods 
within a class.

More about Pointcuts [here](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-aop-pointcut-tutorial#:~:text=In%20Spring%20AOP%2C%20a%20join,way%20of%20describing%20pointcuts%20programmatically.).

Things to mention: AOP by default uses interfaces that the target beans are implementing. If target bean doesn't implement any, CGLIB creates proxies 
via subclassing. Thus it shouldn't come as a surprise to you that AOP doesn't work on final classes/methods. 
AOP also won't catch in-class method invocation - if one method in the target class calls another method in 
the same target class.
