## What is Kubernetes (K8s)?

K8s is basically a program that abstracts the 
hardware / deployment on lower level and allows us
to interact with it with API. It has a huge number of useful features
that makes our (developers) lives easier

- Service: allows communication with the applications (plays the role of a load balancer)
- CoreDNS: translates names to IPs, allowing resources to talk to each other using common names
- Ingress: provides a path resolution to a ClusterIp service. So to allow
a user to reach the application via its web address we would create an ingress resource which
then would store the SSL certificate and offer a path to a service based on that URL.
- Controller Manager: is a service responsible for responding ot node failures, in which case
it will notify the API top move pods from the failed node to a healthy node.
- API Server: component that exposes K8s REST API, front end of the control pane, through which
all communication must pass through
- Scheduler: component that selects the nodes for the pods to run on
