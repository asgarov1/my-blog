# Univerity of York [MSc Computer Science online](https://online.york.ac.uk/study-online/msc-computer-science-online/) experience 

---

I just finished my masters program from university of York and figured review is in order. 

## So first of all why online masters?

In German-speaking countries (I live in Austria) it is possible to get a pretty good Masters program at the FH 
(applied sciences' university) and it will cost less than 1600 EUR in total (I think it was 386 EUR per semester - some german unis even have distance learning options as well but those are usually more expensive) 
So obviously that was the first choice I considered.

Unfortunately Unis in german speaking countries only allow masters in the same field where one got a Bachelor degree from. 
I had a non-technical Bachelor degree, but due to working as a software developer was only interested in Computer Science Masters program. 
German-speaking unis would require me to go through Computer Science Bachelor first - so wasn't really an option.

Luckily, I found out that UK universities have no such limitations. They are happy to accept to normal Computer Science masters 
program anyone with any Bachelor degrees (there is a specialised masters program called "Advanced Compute Science" to which they only take
people with Bachelor of Computer Science).
Some universities, like Bath university, had some additional requirements of wanting to check 
applicants math level due to their CS programs being a bit more math intensive, but 
they told me it is something where they would be willing to work with student to arrive at a solution if needed.

## Why university of York?

So among english speaking universities these were pretty much my choices for CS masters programs online:

- University of York ([#162 world ranking](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-york), [#21 UK ranking](https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2022/sep/24/the-guardian-university-guide-2023-the-rankings)) - costs 7800 GBP
- University of Bath ([#179 world ranking](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-bath), [#8 UK ranking](https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2022/sep/24/the-guardian-university-guide-2023-the-rankings)) - costs something like 13000 GBP
- University of Essex ([#465 world ranking](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/essex-university), [#42 UK ranking](https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2022/sep/24/the-guardian-university-guide-2023-the-rankings)) - around 11222 GBP
- American universities available via coursera starting from 25000 USD+

From the given choices I went with York as it had the best world ranking from the given UK unis and also was the cheapest.

## Starting at the uni

You can start every 3 months and depending on the start date you will start with a different subject. 
One of the things that I liked was that you only learn one subject (they call it module) at a time. 
Each module takes 8 weeks, and you pay modules as you go. So it was about 650 GBP if I remember correctly,
every 8 weeks, then you studied only this one subject and then exam/assignment after which we moved to the next module.

We were also allowed to ask for a break (as in sit out a module) as well as apply for extensions in case we had issues with keeping up. 
In my experience the university was very forthcoming regarding extensions and gave them also for things that could have 
been foreseen or better planned on my side which made the experience much nicer.

## Studying at the uni

In my CS program I had the following modules:
1. Algorithms & Data Structures (prog. language used - Java, assignment + exam, difficulty: medium, hard if you don't know DS at all)
2. Software Engineering (exam, difficulty: medium)
3. Big Data Analytics (assignment, difficulty: medium)
4. Computer Architecture & Operating Systems (exam, difficulty: hard)
5. Computer & Mobile Networks (prog. language used - Java, assignment, difficulty: easy)
6. Research Methods (assignment, difficulty: easy)
7. Cyber-security Threats (assignment, difficulty: easy)
8. Advanced Programming (prog. language used - Python, assignment, difficulty: medium)
9. Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (exam, difficulty: medium)
10. Research Proposal (assignment, difficulty: easy)
11. [Independent Research Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pkLVVdAW-zAuu3WaQDq6xqOllJV98C9zaP66OAceU4k/edit#heading=h.hqjo0ilpd9ev) 
(this last module was the only one to take double as much time - 16 weeks, assignment, difficulty: medium)

Whether you might get exam or assignment is subject to change,
as far as I know they want to do more assignments in the future.

So the university says that the program is suitable for part-time learning and requires 20 hours per week in average. 
This has often been criticised from students, who complained that 20 hours is likely to not be enough and most subjects/people 
require at times full time dedication which is exhausting to many since most people had jobs / families.

I think it strongly depends on if you are already in IT and especially if you are a software dev. If you are not in IT 
(most people were not yet and wanted the degree as a way to start / switch) it is going to be difficult. 
But if you happen to be a software dev like me, you will have much easier time because: 
- you already know half of the algorithms and data structures at some level
- you don't need to spend any time learning prog. language that is being used in some modules
- you are accustomed to unclear requirements and googling information
- and can really pass even with 2-3 weeks of study time (out of 8 weeks given per module)

That being said obviously dedicating the bare minimum prep time (2-3 weeks) just to pass is kind of waste of an opportunity to 
actually learn the subject, so while I liked having that as a fail-safe for when there is too much stress at work, 
I would suggest actually dedicating your time for those 2 years that this master is going to 
take and actually learning the subjects that are actually quite useful in IT and have proven useful to me at work as well.

Also, this is not to say that the program is software development oriented - not at all, 80%+ of the people were not software devs
but this is a software dev oriented blog, so I am letting you know that you will have it easier. You probably shouldn't mention
it to other students though, they are already frustrated and this might come off a little antagonizing, instead just try to help
people with things like programming and algorithms.

Another thing people complained often about was unclear requirements in the assignment briefs. This is totally true, as in the 
assignments are often unclear and tutors are not very helpful at clarifying these, but at the same time the uni is not 
out there to get you. Yes requirements allow for interpretation, but also you really can make reasonable assumptions 
and choices as long as you explain these assumptions/choices and back them up with research / material.

One last thing to know is that because it is an online uni, cooperation is limited to pretty much being forbidden by the uni. This seems
unfair because in normal unis we talked and cooperated in between each other all the time but understandable from uni's point of view.
I felt like students did a good job on discord channel balancing communication and helping each other while staying within the limits of uni's rules.

## Conclusion

I think it can be quite useful and a nice piece of paper / title to earn, and while absolutely everyone likes to complain 
about online programs, they do complain about every single online program out there and imho York is not any worse than others.
People just get frustrated that they pay similar amount of tuition as normal non-online students, but it feels like they have to learn 
everything by ourselves. Since as software devs we anyway need to learn everything by ourselves that didn't bother me, 
but I understand why it
is frustrating to pay and not get much in return.

If you do go for it though, you should do it conscious of the fact that you will have no life for the next 2 years because 
20+ hours of work each week does just that - 
no more time for anything else except studying which should be a priority.

I also recommend taking the program once you are already in the IT because then you will be able to relate and learn more but that of 
course kind of depends on your situation of course. Also, changing jobs tend to require more time so the best thing 
if you have an established job / routine.
