  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>
    My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asgarovjavid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javid Asgarov</a>,
    I am a Software Developer living in Vienna, Austria (the one with Mozart, not the Kangaroos:)
  </p>
  <p>
  I tend to specialize in Java and Deploment Automation but I try to do a bit of Angular as well (must be the masochistic
    tendencies that crave a bit of JS:).
  </p>
  <h4>About this Blog</h4>
  <p>
    Fun fact, this minimalistic blog is written with Angular (this is where you go "yeah, I could tell you are backender:P"),
    with blog posts read from markdown files, hosted on AWS with no Backend.
  </p>
  <p>In this blog I mostly just write down things I find useful and might want to lookup in the future. Occasionally the
    posts seem to be useful for other people as well, which is always nice.</p>
  <h4>Also</h4>
  <p>Check out some IntelliJ/JetBrains IDE plugins that I wrote (they are free) - perhaps useful for you as well.</p>
